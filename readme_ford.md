# Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm

## What it is
The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm computes the maximum flow in a flow network by searching for augmenting paths and increasing the flow until no more paths are found.

## Why it is used
It is a fundamental algorithm for solving maximum flow problems in networks, which is essential for various optimization problems.

## Where it is used
- **Pipeline Network Design**: To maximize the flow of liquids or gases.
- **Image Segmentation**: In computer vision.
- **Bipartite Matching**: For matching problems in bipartite graphs.
- **Telecommunications**: To optimize the flow of data through networks.

## How it works
1. Start with zero flow.
2. While there is an augmenting path, increase the flow.
3. Use DFS or BFS to find paths.
4. Adjust the flows until no more augmenting paths exist.

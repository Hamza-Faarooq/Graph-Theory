# Prim's Algorithm

## What it is
Prim's algorithm is a minimum spanning tree algorithm that grows the spanning tree by adding the cheapest possible connection from the tree to another node.

## Why it is used
It finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph, which minimizes the total weight of the edges.

## Where it is used
- **Telecommunications**: For designing efficient communication networks.
- **Water Supply Networks**: To minimize the cost of pipelines.
- **Computer Networks**: For network design and optimization.
- **Civil Engineering**: In the planning and construction of infrastructure.

## How it works
1. Initialize a tree with a single vertex.
2. Grow the tree by adding the smallest edge from the tree to a new vertex.
3. Repeat until all vertices are included in the tree.

# Dijkstra's Algorithm



## What it is
Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge weights, producing a shortest path tree.

## Why it is used
This algorithm is used to find the shortest paths from a source vertex to all other vertices in a graph, which is essential in optimizing routes and minimizing travel costs.

## Where it is used
- **Network Routing Protocols**: To find the shortest path for data packet transmission.
- **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)**: For route planning and navigation.
- **Robotics and AI**: In pathfinding and motion planning.
- **Transportation Networks**: To optimize travel routes and schedules.

## How it works
1. Initialize distances from the source to all vertices as infinite and distance to the source itself as zero.
2. Use a priority queue to repeatedly extract the vertex with the minimum distance.
3. For the extracted vertex, update the distance for all its adjacent vertices.
4. Repeat until all vertices are processed.

# Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm

## What it is
The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm computes the maximum flow in a flow network by searching for augmenting paths and increasing the flow until no more paths are found.

## How it works
1. Start with zero flow.
2. While there is an augmenting path, increase the flow.
3. Use DFS or BFS to find paths.
4. Adjust the flows until no more augmenting paths exist.


# Kruskal's Algorithm

## What it is
Kruskal's algorithm is a minimum spanning tree algorithm that adds edges to the spanning tree in increasing order of their weights.

## How it works
1. Sort all edges in non-decreasing order of their weight.
2. Pick the smallest edge.
3. Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree formed so far.
4. If no cycle is formed, include this edge. Otherwise, discard it.
5. Repeat until there are (V-1) edges in the spanning tree.



# Prim's Algorithm

## What it is
Prim's algorithm is a minimum spanning tree algorithm that grows the spanning tree by adding the cheapest possible connection from the tree to another node.

## How it works
1. Initialize a tree with a single vertex.
2. Grow the tree by adding the smallest edge from the tree to a new vertex.
3. Repeat until all vertices are included in the tree.
